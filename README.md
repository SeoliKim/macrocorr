# macroecon

Macrocorr (’macroeconomic correlation’) is a Python package for analyzing the correlation between macroeconomic indicators and time-series data. 

This package is designed to analyze and compare the correlations with multiple macroeconomic indicators at a single time. The result is intended to provide an overview of macroeconomic relationships. It should not be used for profitable purposes. 

The data of the macroeconomic indicators are extracted from [WorldBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/) and [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup?s=DATA) historical database. This package doesn’t guarantee the accuracy of the correlated data.

## Installation
